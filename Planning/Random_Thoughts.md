# RANDOM THOUGHTS #

## THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO BE INCLUDED ##

- Configurations files to be saved as within a hidden directory of the home directory as "dot files"
- Configuration files to be JSON files with a custom extension
- Configuration files to inclue information for the SCS work such as 
  - "Key / Value" items for each symbol to be replaced on template files when generating therapy notes
  - Each textfield to be included on each type of therapy note
  - Clients + Client Information
  - MARP Members + Member Information
  - ... etc.
- The user (me) having the ability to dynamically add / remove text fields for each type of therapy note
- The ability to preview what each textfield is replacing on the template (maybe hovering over the textfield will show the sentences before and after what's being replaced?)
- The ability to add / remove / edit template files for therapy notes
- The ability to edit client / marp member information after having already added them as new clients / members
- Spell check in the note preview before copying the note



## THINGS I NEED TO FIGURE OUT ##

- How therapy note temples will be saved - will they be external files, included in the configuration files, or something else?
- The layout of the whole program itself
- Structure of each type of configruation file
- Program Icon
- Will I try to embedd the Python Runtime or keep it being run externally (but removing sandbox and library validation which means can't submit to Apple Store - which I don't really care about)
